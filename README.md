# 🎬 Movie Sentiment Analyzer 🎭

A Streamlit web application that performs **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews using a trained machine learning model. The tool predicts whether a review expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment.

## 🚀 Demo

🌐 Live App: https://movie-sentiment-analyzer-001.streamlit.app/
## 🧠 Features

- Accepts user input as plain text movie reviews.
- Analyzes and classifies sentiment in real-time.
- Uses a pre-trained `TfidfVectorizer` and `LogisticRegression` model.
- User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The user inputs a movie review.
2. The text is transformed using a `TfidfVectorizer`.
3. The resulting features are passed to a `LogisticRegression` classifier.
4. The app displays whether the sentiment is **Positive** or **Negative**.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10**
- **Streamlit** – for frontend deployment
- **Scikit-learn** – for training model and vectorizer
- **Pandas, Numpy** – for data handling
- **Pickle** – to load serialized models

## 💻 Run Locally
